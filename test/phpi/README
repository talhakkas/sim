PHP Interactive - http://www.hping.org/phpinteractive

INTRODUCTION

Playing with langauges like Python, Tcl or Scheme, one of the first nice things
the programmer discovers is a powerful interactive shell where you can try in
little time some line of code, and see the result printed on the standard
output. Unfortunately PHP doesn't have support for such a nice feature, there
is the command line option -a, but it's very rudimentary, and not that useful.
Also what makes php -a not so useful is the fact that PHP is a language for web
applications: often the program output is html code, so, doesn't it make sense
that a PHP shell will run on the web?. This is the simple idea that PHP
Interactive tries to develop.

PHP Interactive is a simple PHP program that lets the user to write code in a
text area (actually multiple text areas, with tabs to switch), and see the
output of the code just pressing the update button. The scripts are persistent,
and the program supports a raw and html output mode, in order to see the raw
script output or to interpret it as html.

INSTALLATION

In order to install PHP Interactive you need to extract the
tar.gz inside your web root and make sure that the owner of
the web server process is able to write inside the "scripts" directory.

Assuming your web server is running as 'www-data' user, you need
to perform the following commands:

  cd /your/web/root/path
  tar xvzf phpinteractive-0.1.tar.gz
  mv phpinteractive_0.1 phpinteractive
  chown www-data:www-data phpinteractive/scripts
  chmod 755 phpinteractive/scripts

Now point your browser at http://localhost/phpinteractive (or what
appropriate), and all should be running.
